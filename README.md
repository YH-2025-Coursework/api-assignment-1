# Workshop API

This repository hosts my ASP.NET Core Web API assignment where I build a CRUD API for managing workshops with DTOs, services, and Entity Framework Core. The goal is to practice structuring a real project, keeping controllers thin, and wiring up async data access via EF Core. I'm opting to run SQL Server in Docker instead of LocalDB so I can get comfortable with containerized databases.
